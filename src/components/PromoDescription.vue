            <h2 class="promo-head">Can I Do It Myself?</h2>
            <p>
                We often get asked this question, and while the answer is technically “yes,” there are critical factors
                to consider as the UK immigration system can be complex to navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make a successful sponsor licence application on your own, you must thoroughly understand and follow
                detailed Home office guidance, avoiding common pitfalls that could lead to rejection. While many people
                manage to do this, it requires a significant investment of time and effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you’re like most HR heads and operations managers, you’d rather spend your time focusing on
                activities like hiring and optimizing business operations. This is where our expertise becomes
                invaluable.
